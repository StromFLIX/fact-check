> ðŸ¤– Conclusion [100/100]: The statement accurately reflects the limitations and recommendations for managing Azure AI services across a large number of customers. It correctly cites the Azure Subscription Limits, allowing up to 16 AI search instances per subscription, and the strategy to spread out up to 1000/3000 indices as needed to accommodate the needs of 1000+ customers. Additionally, the statement correctly identifies the separate handling of Document Intelligence and Language Services to prevent service slowdowns due to high usage by individual customers, supported by the cited limits of 15 transactions per second for Document Intelligence and 1000 transactions per minute for AI Language Service. Each claim is verified and supported by the provided source references and quotes, indicating a high level of truthfulness in the statement.
