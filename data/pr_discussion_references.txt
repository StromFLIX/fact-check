Given the limit of having up to 16 ai search instances for each subscription [Azure Subscription
Limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-limits-quotas-capacity#subscription-limits), it doesn't work well
to give every one of our 1000+ customers their own service. Instead, sharing these services makes more sense because
we can then spread out up to 1000/3000 indices as needed [Index
Limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-limits-quotas-capacity#index-limits). However, for Document
Intelligence and Language Services, it's better to keep them separate for each customer. This way, we avoid any problems if one
customer uses too much and slows down the service for others. The limits are 15 transactions per second for Document
Intelligence [Document Intelligence Service
Limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/service-limits?view=doc-intel-4.0.0#model-usage)
and 1000 transactions per minute for AI Language Service [AI Language Service Rate
Limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/concepts/data-limits#rate-limits).
